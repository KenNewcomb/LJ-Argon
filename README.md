LJ-Argon
=======

A [molecular dynamics (MD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) simulation of liquid argon. The simulation is based on A. Rahman's 1964 paper, "Correlations in the Motion of Atoms in Liquid Argon". In summary, 864 point masses interact with a Lennard-Jones potential and obey classical equations of motion.
