LJ-Argon
=======

A [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) simulation of liquid argon. The simulation is based on A. Rahman's 1964 paper, ["Correlations in the Motion of Atoms in Liquid Argon"](https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.136.A405). In summary, 864 point masses interact with a Lennard-Jones potential and obey classical equations of motion.
