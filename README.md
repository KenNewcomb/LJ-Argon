LJ-Argon
=======

A [molecular dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_dynamics) simulation of liquid argon. The simulation is based on A. Rahman's 1964 paper, ["Correlations in the Motion of Atoms in Liquid Argon"](http://pages.jh.edu/pfleming/compbio/files/rahman_physrev_1964.pdf). In summary, 864 point masses interact with a Lennard-Jones potential and obey classical equations of motion.
